# One Thousand and One Nights: Brazilian Malware Stories

## What is This ?

It's a long-term research project aimed to present a landscape of the malware threats active in the Brazilian cyberspace. This project has started in 2012 and is currently active. We have already analyzed more than 40 thousand unique brazilian malware samples. We are looking for collaborators and contributions. Get in Touch!

## About Us

This research has started been conducted by [Marcus Botacin](www.lasca.ic.unicamp.br/~marcus), started
while a Junior Researcher at the [Institute of
Computing](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/) from [University of
